# Contributing to ICO Stats

In the spirit of decentralization, ICO Stats should operate as an autonomous
entity. We try to achieve this by:

1. Letting users determine the roadmap of ICO Stats.
2. Open-source the code and let anyone contribute.

So there are 2 types of people that will interact with ICO Stats - users, and developers.

For each, the ideal experience with which to do this is different. Users should
not have to make a github account and learn how to use it to suggest a feature.

Also, developers should have the same experience as if they were contributing to
any other open-source project.

Therefore, we have a 2-way sync between our
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/UnsBjG3k/ico-stats-roadmap) and Github. Issues
created in Github will be synced to Trello, and cards created in Trello will be
synced to Github as an issue, IF the card is moved to "Selected for
Development".

Basically, "Selected For Development" in Trello === Github issues.

Users submit their ideas in the "Ideas" list in Trello. This has no effect on
Github. We will let people discuss each and at this point we have to use our
judgment to decide which ones people seem to request the most. In the future,
maybe we can create a voting mechanism using the Ethereum blockchain, and
make a card in "Ideas" automatically move to "Selected for Development" once
it gets a certain number of votes.

So, now as to how to actually contribute:

* If you are not yet added as a collaborator, send your Gitub username to
[me@cooperm.com](mailto:me@cooperm.com) and you'll be added.

* If you are added, simply choose any issue that is not assigned to anyone,
assign it to yourself. Open a PR when you are done.

* If you see PR's open, feel free to review and comment on them. Deciding which
PR's are accepted/rejected should also be a community thing.
